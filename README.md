> **Architecture:** PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) + Neuro‑Symbolic State Decoding  
> **Goal:** Train an Artificial Intelligence agent capable of completing **Pokémon Yellow** from scratch, with *zero prior knowledge*

## 🎯 Project Overview

**PokeAI** is a Deep Reinforcement Learning research project focused on solving **long‑horizon RPG environments**. Pokémon Yellow represents a particularly challenging benchmark due to:

* Extremely sparse rewards
* Large state space
* Long-term dependencies (decisions made minutes or hours earlier)
* Partial observability from pixels alone

To overcome these challenges, PokeAI combines **visual perception** with **explicit symbolic game state extraction**, allowing the agent to both *see* and *understand* the game world.

---

## 🧩 Technical Description

This project implements a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)** architecture designed for complex Game Boy–era RPGs.

Unlike purely vision‑based agents that rely only on raw pixels, PokeAI uses a **Hybrid Observation Space** composed of:

1. **👁️ Vision (CNN-based)**  
   Screen processing to understand local geometry, obstacles, and transitions.

2. **🧠 Memory (RAM Inspection)**  
   Direct reading of emulator memory to extract global context such as:

   * Player coordinates
   * Current map ID
   * Progress flags (e.g., badges)

This neuro‑symbolic approach dramatically improves sample efficiency and stability during training.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **⚡ Accelerated Emulation**  
  Uses **PyBoy** in headless mode during training, achieving speeds of **1000+ FPS**.

* **👁️ Hybrid Observations**  
  The agent not only sees pixels, but *knows* where it is through RAM‑injected state vectors.

* **🗺️ Efficient Exploration**  
  Dense reward shaping based on unique visited coordinates `(x, y)` to mitigate sparse reward issues.

* **🎥 Streamer‑Ready Architecture**  
  Asymmetric design allows full‑speed training in the background while a cloned instance runs at **60 FPS** for live visualization or streaming.

* **⚙️ Consumer‑Hardware Optimized**  
  Thread control (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`) and custom `SleepCallback` allow training + streaming on mid‑range CPUs (e.g., i5 / Ryzen 5) without system freezes.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.11** (Conda recommended)
* **Pokémon Yellow ROM**  
  Must be named exactly `PokemonYellow.gb` and placed inside the `roms/` directory.

### Step‑by‑Step Guide

#### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PokeAI.git
cd PokeAI
```

#### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment

```bash
conda create -n pokeai python=3.11
conda activate pokeai
```

#### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install gymnasium pyboy shimmy stable-baselines3[extra] opencv-python torch-directml
```

#### 4️⃣ Generate the initial save state (Skip Intro)

To prevent the agent from wasting hours navigating menus, create a save state immediately after the intro sequence.

```bash
python src/utils/create_initial_state.py
```

> **Instruction:** Manually play until you gain control of the character in Ash’s room, then close the window.

## 🏃 Workflow & Execution

PokeAI is designed to run in **two terminals simultaneously**:

* **🧠 Brain:** High‑speed training
* **👀 Eyes:** Real‑time visualization

---

### 🧠 1. Training (The Brain)

Runs the PPO training loop in headless mode for maximum performance.

* **CPU Usage:** Optimized for 1–2 cores
* **Checkpoints:** Automatically saved to `experiments/`

```bash
python train.py
```

> Press **Ctrl + C** at any time to trigger a safe emergency checkpoint.

---

### 👀 2. Visualization (The Eyes)

Displays the agent playing at **60 FPS**.

* Automatically detects improved models
* Hot‑reloads new checkpoints without restarting

```bash
python watch_continuous.py
```

---

### 📊 3. Monitoring (Analytics)

Visualize reward curves, loss, and entropy in real time:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir experiments/poke_ppo_v1/logs
```

---

## 🧠 Agent Architecture

### Action Space

**Discrete (6 actions):**

```
[DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, A, B]
```

> `START` and `SELECT` are intentionally disabled to reduce stochastic noise and avoid menu‑locking behaviors.

---

### Reward Shaping

The current reward function emphasizes **pure exploration**:

[
R_t = R_{exploration} + R_{events}
]

* **Exploration Reward:** +1.0 for each unique `(x, y)` coordinate visited per map
* **Inactivity Penalty (Implicit):** No reward for standing still forces movement through optimization pressure
